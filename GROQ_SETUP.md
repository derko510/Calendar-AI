# ✅ Groq API Setup Complete

## Configuration Applied:
- **LLM Provider**: Groq Cloud API
- **Model**: llama-3.1-70b-versatile (70 billion parameters!)
- **API Key**: Configured
- **Mode**: Production

## What Changed:
- Switched from local Ollama (qwen2.5:7b) to Groq API
- Much faster inference speed
- Dramatically improved natural language understanding
- Better conversation memory and context handling

## Benefits:
- **10x faster** responses than local model
- **10x smarter** with 70B parameters vs 7B
- **Better reasoning** for complex requests
- **Improved conversation flow** for confirmations

## Restart Required:
Stop the server (Ctrl+C) and restart with:
```bash
cd server && npm run dev
```

The server should now show "Cloud LLM" instead of "Ollama" on startup.

## Expected Improvements:
- "create studying on 16th at 1pm" → "yes" should work perfectly
- Better intent detection and confirmation handling
- More natural conversation flow
- Faster response times
